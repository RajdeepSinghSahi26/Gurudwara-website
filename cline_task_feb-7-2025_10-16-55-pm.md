<task>
Create a professional website for "Gurudwara Singh Sabha" in Punjabi using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The website should include:  
1. A *Home Page* with an introduction, images, and a navigation menu.  
2. A *Management Committee Page* with details about "Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee" (President, Secretary, Members).  
3. A *Sewadar Duties Page* showing different seva responsibilities (Langar, Cleaning, Kirtan).  
4. A *Financial Transparency Page* listing all expenditures for Gurudwara construction with interactive cards instead of tables.  
5. A *Sewa Contributions Page* where users can offer financial Sewa (instead of "donation") and view Sewa records.  
6. A *Modern, professional UI* with a clean design, avoiding simple tables. Use cards, sections, and interactive elements.  
7. Ensure the content is in *Punjabi (Gurmukhi script)* and the design reflects *Sikh aesthetics*.  
8. Make the website *responsive* for mobile and desktop.  
9. Organize the project into folders:  
   - gurudwara/ (Root folder)  
     - index.html (Home Page)  
     - committee.html (Management Committee)  
     - duties.html (Sewadar Duties)  
     - financial.html (Financial Info)  
     - sewa.html (Sewa Contributions)  
     - css/ (Styles)  
       - style.css  
     - js/ (Scripts)  
       - script.js  
     - images/ (Gurudwara images)  
10. Use *Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS* for a modern look.  
11. Implement a *secure online Sewa payment system* (optional for later).

[ERROR] You did not use a tool in your previous response! Please retry with a tool use.

# Reminder: Instructions for Tool Use

Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.

# Next Steps

If you have completed the user's task, use the attempt_completion tool. 
If you require additional information from the user, use the ask_followup_question tool. 
Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task.

**Assistant:**

<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</list_files>

<thinking>
First, I need to understand the existing file structure to properly organize the new website files according to the user's requirements. The user specified a particular folder structure but the environment_details show files might be in unexpected locations (like styles.css in Assets/images/receipts/). 

By listing all files recursively, I can:
1. Verify existing directories (css/, js/, images/)
2. Check for existing HTML files and their locations
3. Identify any conflicting files that need to be moved or overwritten
4. Confirm the correct paths for writing new files

This will ensure I create the website structure exactly as requested while preserving any existing assets.
